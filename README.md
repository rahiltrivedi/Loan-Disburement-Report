# 📊 Loan Disbursement & NPA Analysis Dashboard

A professional-grade dashboard project built using **Power BI**, **MySQL**, and **Excel** to analyze loan disbursement trends, loan types, and the emergence of NPAs (Non-Performing Assets) across time.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates how a financial institution like a bank monitors and analyzes its loan distribution across multiple categories such as **Home Loans**, **Personal Loans**, **Gold Loans**, and **Education Loans**, while also keeping track of **NPAs**. The data pipeline involves:

- **Excel** for initial cleaning and manual transformations  
- **MySQL** to simulate a backend database with real SQL operations  
- **Power BI** for visual storytelling, KPI tracking, and dynamic dashboards
